The name's **Xander**, and I'm a 3rd year university student at <a href="https://www.macewan.ca/home/" target="_blank">Macewan</a> studying Computer Science and Business Management.<br/> 
I'm highly passionate about software and enjoy the challenge of bringing ideas to life with code. Check the [projects](/projects) tab to see!<br/>

Here's a little bit about me:

## Hobbies

---

### Rock Climbing
Nothing beats the feeling of sending a tough project (except centering a div).

### Coding
Need I say more? It's _almost_ an obsession for me.

### Guitar
I can get lost on the fretboard for hours.
